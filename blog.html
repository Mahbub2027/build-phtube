        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-10">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
        <p>The keywords for declaring variables in javascript are var, let, and const. A variable can be declared in
            javascript using the venerable Var variable method. We utilize the let and const variables in the current
            javascript, which was included in the ES2015(ES6) update; it is now used more commonly in modern javascript
            than the var variable.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-5">Var</h2> <hr>
        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">Var declarations can be function/locally or globally scoped.

            When a var variable is declared outside of a function, the scope is global. This means that any variable
            declared outside of a function block using the var keyword is accessible throughout the entire window.

            When a variable is declared inside a function, it has function scope. This indicates that it is accessible
            and limited to that function.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-5">Let</h2> <hr>
        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">The scope of a let variable is block scope.It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.It can
            be declared without initialization. It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give
            ‘referenceError’. </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-5">Const</h2> <hr>
        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">Constant values are kept for variables specified using the const keyword. Let declarations and const
            declarations have some similarities.
            The scope of const declarations is blocked. Const declarations, like let declarations are only accessible
            within the block in which they were made. It is impossible to modify or re-declare const.</p>

        <!-- 2nd question -->

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-10">Use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-5">Null</h2> <hr>
        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a
            variable whose value is assigned as null. converts to 0 then perform the operation. Yes, as we assign null
            to a variable, it is an assignment value.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-5">Undefined</h2> <hr>
        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.The typeof() operator
            returns undefined for an undefined variable. It returns NaN on performing arithmetic operations. No, as
            there is no value assigned to the variable, it becomes undefined.</p>

        <!-- 3rd question -->
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold my-10">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can
            connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of
            the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes
            referred to RESTful APIs.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-5">How REST APIs work?</h2> <hr>
        <p class="mt-5 text-justify">REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading,
            updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a
            GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a
            DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar
            to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.</p>
